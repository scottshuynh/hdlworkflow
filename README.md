# hdlworkflow
All HDL simulators follow the same process (analyse, elaborate and simulate) though each uses its own variation of these commands. `hdlworkflow` abstracts away the simulator-specific commands to simplify simulation project creation.

## Supported tools
+ [nvc](https://github.com/nickg/nvc)
+ [Riviera-PRO](https://www.aldec.com/en/products/functional_verification/riviera-pro)
+ [Vivado](https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/vivado.html)

## Supported waveform viewers
+ [gtkwave](https://github.com/gtkwave/gtkwave)

## Compatibility table
Each column shows support simulators and their compatibility with tools listed in the left-most column.

## Install
`hdlworkflow` is a Python package and can be installed by following the steps below:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/scottshuynh/hdlworkflow.git
cd hdlworkflow
pip install .
```

## How to run
`hdlworkflow` can be run in command line and requires the following arguments:
+ Simulator of choice.
+ Entity name of top level design.
+ Path to a file containing a list of all files used to simulate the top design file.

A directory with the name of the chosen simulator will be created in the directory `hdlworkflow` is run. This directory will contain all output artefacts produced by the simulator and waveform viewer.

*Note*: All HDL will be compiled into the *work* library.

---
### nvc
Simulate a top level design named `design_tb` using the `nvc` HDL simulator. All files required to simulate `design_tb` are listed as *absolute* paths line by line in `compile_order.txt`:
```sh
hdlworkflow nvc design_tb compile_order.txt
```

If `design_tb` requires `DATA_WIDTH` and `ADDR_WIDTH` generic declared:
```sh
hdlworkflow nvc design_tb compile_order.txt -g DATA_WIDTH=8 -g ADDR_WIDTH=4
```

If a waveform viewer, gtkwave, is required:
```sh
hdlworkflow nvc design_tb compile_order.txt --wave gtkwave
```

If the testbench `design_tb` is a cocotb test module, and the top level design is called `design`:
```sh
hdlworkflow nvc design compile_order_txt --cocotb design_tb
```

Cocotb test modules will be discovered in the same directory that `hdlworkflow` is run.
Adding to `PYTHONPATH` is also supported:
```sh
hdlworkflow nvc design compile_order_txt --cocotb design_tb --pythonpath /abs/path/to/python/module --pythonpath relative/path/to/python/module
```

---
### Riviera-PRO
Simulate a top level design named `design_tb` using the `riviera` HDL simulator. All files required to simulate `design_tb` are listed as *absolute* paths line by line in `compile_order.txt`:
```sh
hdlworkflow riviera design_tb compile_order.txt
```

If `design_tb` requires `DATA_WIDTH` and `ADDR_WIDTH` generic declared:
```sh
hdlworkflow riviera design_tb compile_order.txt -g DATA_WIDTH=8 -g ADDR_WIDTH=4
```

If a GUI is required to view waveforms:
```sh
hdlworkflow riviera design_tb compile_order.txt --wave riviera
```

If the testbench `design_tb` is a cocotb test module, and the top level design is called `design`:
```sh
hdlworkflow riviera design compile_order_txt --cocotb design_tb
```

Cocotb test modules will be discovered in the same directory that `hdlworkflow` is run.
Adding to `PYTHONPATH` is also supported:
```sh
hdlworkflow riviera design compile_order_txt --cocotb design_tb --pythonpath /abs/path/to/python/module --pythonpath relative/path/to/python/module
```

---
### Vivado
Create a project with a top level design named `design_tb` using `Vivado`. All files required to synthesise/simulate `design_tb` are listed as *absolute* paths line by line in `compile_order.txt`:
```sh
hdlworkflow vivado design_tb compile_order.txt
```

If `design_tb` requires `DATA_WIDTH` and `ADDR_WIDTH` generic declared:
```sh
hdlworkflow vivado design_tb compile_order.txt -g DATA_WIDTH=8 -g ADDR_WIDTH=4
```

Additionally, if you wanted to set the part number `xczu7ev-ffvc1156-2-e` for your OOC synthesis:
```sh
hdlworkflow vivado design_tb compile_order.txt -g DATA_WIDTH=8 -g ADDR_WIDTH=4 --part xczu7ev-ffvc1156-2-e
```

Additionally, if you wanted to set the board part (`ZCU106`) for your OOC synthesis:
```sh
hdlworkflow vivado design_tb compile_order.txt -g DATA_WIDTH=8 -g ADDR_WIDTH=4 --part xczu7ev-ffvc1156-2-e --board xilinx.com:zcu106:part0:2.6  
```

#### Notes
+ `hdlworkflow` will open `Vivado` GUI and run in [project mode](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug892-vivado-design-flows-overview/Project-Mode). GUI-less mode not yet implemented.
+ `hdlworkflow` will configure `Vivado` synthesis as [out-of-context](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug949-vivado-design-methodology/Out-of-Context-Synthesis).
+ A clock constraint of 500 MHz is set up by default to constrain the clock port `clk_i`.
+ `hdlworkflow` will configure `Vivado` with [Artix-7](https://www.amd.com/en/products/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/fpga/artix-7.html) as the default part number. Use `--part` and/or `--board` positional arguments to specify target hardware.
+ `Vivado` will use its native waveform viewer instead of third party waveform viewers. 
+ `Vivado` is *not* compatible with `cocotb`. `hdlworkflow` will raise an error if attempting to use `cocotb` with `Vivado`.
